supermemory syncs Google Drive documents automatically and instantaneously.

## Supported file types

- Google Docs
- Google Slides
- Google Sheets

## Conversions

To import items, supermemory converts documents into markdown, and then ingests them into supermemory.
This conversion is lossy, and some formatting may be lost.

## Sync frequency

supermemory syncs documents:
- **A document is modified or created (Webhook recieved)**
    - Note that not all providers are synced via webhook (Instant sync right now)
    - `Google-Drive` and `Notion` documents are synced instantaneously
- Every **four hours**
- On **Manual Sync** (API call)
    - You can call `/v3/connections/{provider}/sync` to sync documents manually
