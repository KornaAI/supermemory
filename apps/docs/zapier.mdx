With Supermemory you can now easily add memory to your Zapier workflow steps. Here's how:

## Prerequisites
- A Supermemory API Key. Get yours [here](console.supermemory.ai)

## Step-by-step tutorial

For this tutorial, we're building a simple flow that adds incoming emails in Gmail to Supermemory.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Make a flow">
        Open your Zapier account and click on 'Zap' to make a new automation.
        ![make a zap - annotated](/images/make-zap.png)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add Gmail node">
        Add a new Gmail node that gets triggered on every new email. Connect to your Google account.
        ![add gmail](/images/add-gmail-node-zapier.png)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add code block">
        Now, add a new 'Code by Zapier' block. Set it up to run Python.

        In the **Input Data** section, map the content field to the Gmail raw snippet.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Integrate Supermemory">
        Since we're ingesting data here, we'll use the [add documents endpoint.](/api-reference/manage-documents/add-document)

        Add the following code block:
        
        ```python 
            import requests

            url = "https://api.supermemory.ai/v3/documents"

            payload = { "content": inputData['content'], "containerTag": "gmail" }
            headers = {
                "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_SM_API_KEY",
                "Content-Type": "application/json"
            }

            response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)

            print(response.json())
        ```

        The `inputData['content']` field maps to the Gmail content fetched from Zapier.

    </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
    Sometimes Zapier might show an error on the first test run. It usually works right after. Weird bug, we know.

You can perform other operations like search, filtering, user profiles, etc., by using other Supermemory API endpoints which can be found in our [API Reference.](api-reference/search/search-memory-entries)
