### The problem

...so you want to build your own memory layer. Let's go through your decision process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Let's choose a vector database">
    <Card title="Found a vector database?">
      - Oh no, it's way too expensive. Time to switch.
      - Turns out it's painfully slow. Let's try another.
      - Great, now it won't scale. Back to square one.
      - The maintenance is a nightmare. Need something else.
    </Card>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Now for the embedding model">
    <Card title="Unless you have a PhD in AI, good luck figuring out:">
      - Which model fits your use case
      - What are the performance tradeoffs
      - How to keep up with new releases
    </Card>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Time to build the memory layer">

      <Card title="So many types of content">
        - Websites: How do you handle JavaScript? What about rate limits?
        - PDFs: OCR keeps failing, text extraction is inconsistent
        - Images: Need computer vision models now?
        - Audio/Video: Transcription costs add up quickly
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>
  </Step>
</Steps>

And in the middle of all this, you're wondering...
